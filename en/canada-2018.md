# NomadConf Canada 2018

NomadConf are unconferences to grow your professional nomadic practices… and to spend a good time between ephemeral coworking in trains and meeting local communities! This edition will take place in Canada in the second week of November 2018 and is organized by Clémentine Hahn and Matti Schneider.

## When slowing down allows us to go faster, further… or simply elsewhere?

For this edition, we want to explore our relationship to time and productivity. Agile and lean methods recommend to move fast (and break things). Deliver quickly. Test quickly.

But why? Has moving fast become a goal in itself?

The widespread adoption of these practices leads to their application to all types of problems. Service design, public service design, design of systems that become embedded in the lives of users or in society. Can we really approach this type of system unaware of its slower time? And can we do this while in a hurry? Since we need to change our spatiality (“get out of the building”) to fully understand the problems we are trying to solve, why not also change our temporality?

Without going back to waterfall, we aim at questioning agile and lean practices to **identify the occasions when we wrongly believe that going fast holds some intrinsic virtue**.

## The invitation

**Each person brings a topic they are working on, and that is complex enough to deserve a few days of work.** A topic where one feels that their usual approach may not be the best fit is the most relevant. This topic may be technical (a software architecture to be rebuilt…), organizational (the limits of a team…), professional (a career change…), philosophical (a change in lifestyle…). It can be anything as long as it is scoped well enough to measure progress, important enough to want to think about it and work alone on it for several hours, and understandable enough to receive help.

We will individually and collectively seek to identify the moments when we mix ends and means. Our aim will be to reclaim our ability to use slower time. To do this, we will use leverage two opportunities brought by soft mobility:

- First, working on usual subjects in an unusual situation by creating a temporary remote working space on the train. This shift in cognitive constraints (fewer interruptions, a changing landscape, less connectivity, shared space…) changes our relationship to the problems we are trying to solve.
- Second, by sharing these cognitive changes with others who are also experiencing them, creating a variety of experiences and interpretations.


## Proposal 1: _The Transcontinental_

From Saturday, November 10 to Sunday, November 18, 2018, from Toronto to Vancouver: 2 segments / 8 days / 2200 CA$.
_Is this rate too high? You can apply for a grant, or travel in a reclining seat instead of a berth, for a total of $900 CA$._
