## When slowing down allows us to go faster, further… or simply elsewhere?

For this edition, we want to explore our relationship to time and productivity. Agile and lean methods recommend to move fast (and break things). Deliver quickly. Test quickly.

But why? Has moving fast become a goal in itself?

The widespread adoption of these practices leads to their application to all types of problems. Service design, public service design, design of systems that become embedded in the lives of users or in society. Can we really approach this type of system unaware of its slower time? And can we do this while in a hurry? Since we need to change our spatiality (“get out of the building”) to fully understand the problems we are trying to solve, why not also change our temporality?

Without going back to waterfall, we aim at questioning agile and lean practices to **identify the occasions when we wrongly believe that going fast holds some intrinsic virtue**.

## The invitation

**Each person brings a topic they are working on, and that is complex enough to deserve a few days of work.** A topic where one feels that their usual approach may not be the best fit is the most relevant. This topic may be technical (a software architecture to be rebuilt…), organizational (the limits of a team…), professional (a career change…), philosophical (a change in lifestyle…). It can be anything as long as it is scoped well enough to measure progress, important enough to want to think about it and work alone on it for several hours, and understandable enough to receive help.

We will individually and collectively seek to identify the moments when we mix ends and means. Our aim will be to reclaim our ability to use slower time. To do this, we will use leverage two opportunities brought by soft mobility:

- First, working on usual subjects in an unusual situation by creating a temporary teleworking space on the train. This shift in cognitive constraints (fewer interruptions, a changing landscape, less connectivity, shared space…) changes our relationship to the problems we are trying to solve.
- Second, by sharing these cognitive changes with others who are also experiencing them, creating a variety of experiences and interpretations.


## The program _[transcontinental path hypothesis]_

- We meet in the starting city. One to two hours of facilitated meeting to discover each other and present the topics to be discussed.
- We get on the train and start taking over the space. Peer support to learn how to work in this context.
- We work in pairs for a few hours, rotating topics and pairs.
- Sharing and retrospective of this first part at lunch.
- Individual working time.
- Meeting time: in the dining car, each pair dines with other travellers who are not part of the group.
- Sharing and retrospective of this second time by admiring the landscapes and then the sky in the observation car.
- Overnight in bunks (grouped by snoring/non-snoring and expected sleep and wake times).
- Free waking up time.
- Group work time.
- Meeting time: in the restaurant car, we have lunch in pairs with other travellers who are not part of the group.
- Break time: getting off the train and exploring a city, walking in the countryside, meeting a local group.
- The two days described above are repeated for the second half of the trip.
